    "A Regular Expressions (RegEx) is a special sequence of characters that uses a search pattern to find a string or set of strings. It can detect the presence or absence of a text by matching it with a particular pattern, and also can split a pattern into one or more sub-patterns. Python provides a re module that supports the use of regex in Python. Its primary function is to offer a search, where it takes a regular expression and a string. Here, it either returns the first match or else none.\n",

    "Raw strings are used so that backslashes do not have to be escaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Raw Strings are string literals prefixed with a \"r\" or \"R\". For example, r\"Hello\" is a raw string. Raw Strings do not treat backslashes (\"\\\") as part of an escape sequence. It will be printed normally as a result\n",
    "\n",
    "Python raw string treats the backslash character (\"\\\") as a literal character. Raw string is useful when a string needs to contain a backslash, such as for a regular expression or Windows directory path, and you don't want it to be treated as an escape character"
