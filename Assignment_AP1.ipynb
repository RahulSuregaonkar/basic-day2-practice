    "Ans: Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) uses objects and classes in programming.\n",
    "It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
    "The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "It comes up with the following advantages:\n",
    "It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making it solving easy with the use of objects\n",
    "Helps in easy maintenance and modification of existing program\n",
    "Multiple instances of an object can be made."

    "\n",
    "1. Class is a template for creating objects whereas object is an instance of class\n",
    "2. Seperate memory is allocated for each object whenever an object is created. but for a class this doesnot happens.\n",
