    "1. Comparison operators\n",
    "If you were to choose a stream between Science, Commerce and Humanities, you would weigh out their pros and cons and accordingly take a decision. When we want to decide between 2 or more options, we compare them based on their weights.\n",

    "The Boolean operators in Python are widely used and have numerous applications in functions and conditional statements. Logical operators like and, or, not and comparison operators like ==, !=, >,<, >=, <= are used to compare values and result in Boolean Outputs of True and False. Truth tables are used to summarize the outputs of these operations. Comparison operators can also be chained for ease of coding but might lead to short-circuiting.\n"
